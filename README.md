# 🩺 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Machine Learning

An end-to-end AI-powered medical imaging system for detecting and grading Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using OCT and Fundus retinal images. The project combines deep learning–based feature extraction with classical machine learning to deliver accurate, interpretable, and efficient diagnosis support.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a hybrid machine learning framework that leverages a pretrained VGG16 CNN for deep feature extraction and LightGBM for classification. The system analyzes retinal images to classify patients into Normal, Moderate DR, and Severe DR stages. The approach focuses on high accuracy, reduced computational cost, and model interpretability, making it suitable for real-world clinical and tele-ophthalmology applications.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ User provides OCT or Fundus retinal images

2️⃣ Images are resized, normalized, and preprocessed

3️⃣ VGG16 CNN extracts deep visual features

4️⃣ Features are standardized and passed to LightGBM

5️⃣ Model predicts the Diabetic Retinopathy stage

6️⃣ Output includes prediction label and confidence score
